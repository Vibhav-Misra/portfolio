◉ An interactive chatbot trained on my resume, deployed on Vercel, powered by Groq LLM API.

◉ Users can ask questions about my background, skills, education, experience, or projects and get fast, on-topic answers directly from the resume.

◉ **Overview**
<p style="margin-top:1rem;"></p>
- Uses a fixed knowledge base (My resume text) – no need for a vector DB.
- Built as a Next.js / Vercel serverless API endpoint (/api/chat).
- Talks to Groq’s OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions API with modern LLaMA 3 models.
- Front-end is a minimal chat UI deployed along with the backend.
- The project is designed to be cheap to run (no RAG or embeddings) and simple to maintain.

description: Why I tore down my old portfolio and rebuilt it with Astro, Tailwind, and MDX.
---

Welcome to the new site!  

For a while my old portfolio felt… like a college dorm room. It worked, but it was cramped, messy, and every time I wanted to add a new project I had to shove another box into the corner. It was time for an upgrade.

## Why rebuild (again)?

Two reasons:

1. **Flexibility.** I wanted a place where I could post not just polished projects but also share jupyter noteboks, code snippets, visualizations and also write blogs.
2. **Modern stack.** I’d been curious about Astro and wanted to see how it feels to build a site that’s fast, simple to deploy, and friendly to both static and dynamic content.

## Stack choices 

- **Astro** -> For its island architecture and smooth content collections. It lets me write blog posts in MDX and render project cards without fighting a huge frontend framework.
- **Tailwind CSS** -> I used to write custom CSS for everything; now I just sprinkle utility classes and focus on layout and design.
- **MDX** -> Because plain Markdown is great… until you want to drop in a chart or a custom React component. MDX keeps things flexible.

I also wired up content collections so blog posts and project pages can live alongside their data, which means no more copy-pasting routes or templates.

## What you’ll find here

I’ll be using this space to:
- Share write-ups of data science projects (with code, visuals, and even the mistakes I made).
- Post notebooks or EDA walkthroughs that deserve more explanation than a README.
- Occasionally write about tools, workflows, or just what I’m learning.

The goal is to make this site feel more like a working lab notebook than a static resume.

Until then, thanks for stopping by.  
If something looks broken, that’s probably just me tinkering again, so please bear with me :)

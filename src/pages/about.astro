<Base title="About — Vibhav Misra">
<section class="mx-auto max-w-6xl px-4 py-12 prose prose-invert">
<h1>About</h1>
<p>Hi, I’m Vibhav Misra, a Data Science master’s student at Pace University in New York City. I’m passionate about building practical machine learning systems and turning complex data into clear, actionable insights.</p>
  
<p>Before moving to NYC, I completed my bachelor’s degree in Computer Science with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.</p>
  
<p>Beyond the classroom, I explore how data and storytelling can intersect, whether that’s through well-designed dashboards, interactive visualizations, or writing about my learning process. I see data science not just as algorithms, but as a way to explain, predict, and engage.</p>

<p>
